1. Delete functionality is straightforward, the only thing I had to do is to remove item from state. Item template was moved to a separate slim presentation component.

2. Toggling status is very similar to delete functionality. I introduced immuntable js to help me write reducer (it is a lot easier to return new state with immuntable js)

3. derived data. Reselect package was used to return derived data for filtered todo list (and there is performance benefit by using reselect as well)

4. Tests were written to cover all new features

In terms of potential improvements, I would like to move action creators into separate files. In a real world app, action creators could get large very quickly, especially if there are aync operations.

There is also scope to split reduce action handlers (switch statement) into separate methods
